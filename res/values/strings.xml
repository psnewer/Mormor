    <string name="ABOUT_WINDOW">"New-Morph is an image deformation tool. You can reshape the contour to reshape the objects on the image, keeping the area nearby unchanged. The contour can either be generated automatically or be drawn„ÄÅerased and fixed by yourself.

We suggest you get the contour by system firstly, then fix the contour using the tools we provide. The small flaws on the contour will be fixed by system automatically. It may tack minutes to get the contour, but the result will be amazing.

After generate the deformed picture, please slide the sliders again to adjust the distinctness in the deformation area before you dismiss the morphing dialog.

We hope you enjoy using it. Have a problem? Have a question? We're here to help: "<a href="mailto:adnewer@Gmail.com">Email us</a>.</string>
